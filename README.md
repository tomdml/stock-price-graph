# stock-price-graph
Graph the daily price changes of a stock market ticker.

Given a ticker, this tool will overlay the last 90 days of price changes on one graph. This allows the user to see whether a stock has predictable price changes that occur at the same time each day (Spoiler alert: They don't!)
